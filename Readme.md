# Conformal Off-Policy Prediction

This repository is the official implementation of of [Conformal Off-policy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.06711.pdf).  It includes the toy example 
in Section 3.2 and the synthetic data analysis in Section 5.


### Requirements: 
The experiments is run in R 4.0.3. It requires R packages "grf", "gbm", "bartMachine","randomForest","glmnet","ggplot2"

### Training:
1. Toy example is implemented in the folder [Figure1](https://github.com/callmespring/COPP/tree/main/Figure1): 
    `DirectM.R`:                the function for direct method, we can choose true/false model, deterministic/random policy
    `SS_low_DirectM.R`:   run 100 repetitions for Direct method

    `SamplingM.R`:                the function for subsampling method,we can choose true/false model, deterministic/random policy
    `SS_low_SamplingM.R`:    run 100 repetitions for Subsampling method

    `AOPM.R`:                the function for COPP method,we can choose true/false model, deterministic/random policy
    `SS_low_AOPM.R`:   run 100 repetitions for COPP method

    `conformal_utils.R`:  functions for conformal prediction
    `genY.R`:   data generation

    All training setups in `SS_low_DirectM.R`,  `SS_low_SamplingM.R`, `SS_low_AOPM.R` are the same with the paper.

2.  Synthetic data analysis is implemented in the folder [Figure2](https://github.com/callmespring/COPP/tree/main/Figure2).

    `conformal_learners.R`:           prediction models such as quantile random forest        
    `conformal_utils.R`:                 functions for weighted conformal prediction, construct CI
    `conformalCI.R`:                      the main function COPP for single-stage decision making, Algorithm 1 in main paper
    `conformalCI_TS.R`:                 the main function COPP for multi-stage decision making, Alogorithm 1 in supp
    `genY.R`:                                  data generation 
    `propensityscore.R`:                prediction models for propensity score such as  logistic regression
    `quantilereg.R`:                        convert a valid outfun string to the function
    `samplesplit.R`:                        split samples randomly as training and calibration sets
   
    `SS_high_BootDweight.R`:         high dim,single-stage, implement 100 repetitions of the COPP_IS_MS method(B=100, method="BootDweight"), COPP_IS(B=1, method="Dweight")
    `SS_high_BootSweight.R`:          high dim,single-stage,  implement 100 repetitions of  the COPP_MS method(B=100, method="BootSweight"), COPP(B=1, method="Sweight")
    `SS_high_naive.R`:                      high dim,single-stage,  implement 100 repetitions of  the Subsampling-based method

    `SS_low_BootDweight.R`:          low dim,single-stage,  implement 100 repetitions of  COPP_IS_MS method(B=100, method="BootDweight"), COPP_IS(B=1, method="Dweight")
    `SS_low_BootSweight.R`:           low dim,single-stage,  implement 100 repetitions of  COPP_MS method(B=100, method="BootSweight"), COPP(B=1, method="Sweight")
    `SS_low_naive.R`:                       low dim,single-stage,  implement 100 repetitions of  Subsampling-based method
    `SS_low_IPWE.R`:                       low dim,single-stage,  implement 100 repetitions of  IS and DR method

    `TS_XXX_XXX.R` is the same as SS but for two-stage setting

### Resultsï¼š
All results have been described in our paper. The boxplots in the paper are summarized by the 100 repetitions in the
`summary.R` in [Figure1](https://github.com/callmespring/COPP/tree/main/Figure1) and `summary_high.R`, `summary_low.R` in [Figure2](https://github.com/callmespring/COPP/tree/main/Figure2).
